# 08 — Research log

Dated entries. Keep failed attempts.

## 2026-10-09 (Fri)
- Repo scaffolded: pipeline ingest → clean → segment → windows → time-block split → baselines (persistence/CV/CTRV) → vessel-bootstrap evaluation.
- 11 unit tests pass; end-to-end smoke test on SYNTHETIC data works.
- Synthetic observation (not a finding): CTRV beats CV at 5 min but is worse at 20 min when turns are short-lived. Check on real data whether to damp the turn rate over time.
- Next: download the first DMA day, write the manifest, inspect the header and reporting intervals, and pick the AOI.
